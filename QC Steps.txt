Below is the QC steps for the folder:

1. Run the program, and use the easygui output to select the folder you want to run in.
2. Check for any errors (any peaks in the graph or parsing errors from incorrect namings) and fix them manually.
3. The program internally takes care of renaming the rest of the images, and then creates an excel spreadsheet with the data
4. Create the necessary folder structure (wrap the folder an excel sheet in a parent folder with the same name) and upload to Sharepoint

The only thing that should be added is to automatically physically changed the names to the new file names after execution. 
Right now, the program does the main task by renaming internally in the code, but the files in the folder should be renamed as well.
